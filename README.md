# servlet-likecount-page
Hello y'all
This is a simple servlet page that is coded in java
I used apache tomcat 8.0.27 to run the code.
Put the folders as such into the webapps folder.
Run the localhost and navigate to the index.html file.
Run the html file and check out how the servlet responds to the likes that gets counted.
More importantly the program runs only in mozilla firefox.
Tell me if you have any problem in running the program.

Have a great day.......
